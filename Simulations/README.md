# Death Trap Amplifier Simulations

This directory contains simulations designed to assist in designing, modifying, or troubleshooting the DTA design.

* **amp-simulation.asc**  ([LTSpice](http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/#LTspice))  
  Contains a simultation of the preamp and poweramp stages.  
  This simulation relies on `triodes.inc` and `tetrode_pentode.inc` for tube profiles
  
* **Main_PSU.psu** ([Duncan PSU Designer II](http://www.duncanamps.com/psud2/index.html))
  Contains a simulation of the main (B+) power supply.
  
* **Bias_PSU.psu** ([Duncan PSU Designer II](http://www.duncanamps.com/psud2/index.html))
  Contains a simulation of the Bias (C-) power supply.
